This is a list of known issues/things to bear in mind.

0001    Don't leave whitespace like

        </li>

        <li>

        or texml will insert extra <p>/</p> tags between them.

        In fact, don't leave random whitespace unless you're sure you want <p> tags.

0002    Always put \[...\] around align, align*, gathers.

        If you don't, texml will not go through them and replace < with &lt; etc

0003    Always put a \begin{something}[label] on its own line. Same for \end.

0004    When beginning an environment, you have to call it the thing you want it to 
        appear as, e.g. \begin{Lemma} rather than \begin{lma}
