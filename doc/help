The sourcefiles are written in a slightly confusing mix of TeX and HTML.
This is (paradoxically) to make life easier for both the code and for the user.
As time goes on, it should become more TeX-like, in particular:

* tables and lists are currently just coded as HTML.

* hyperlinks are coded using <a> tags

It would be nice to find a TeXier way of doing this.

########### STRUCTURE OF SOURCEFILES

\documentclass{amsart}  ### Lines like this are redundant, but I left them in
                        ### because at some point I want to be able to compile
                        ### these files as actual LaTeX.

\title{Title}           ### This is necessary metadata for the XML
\author{Author 1}       ### So is this
\email{Email 1}         ### This is optional
\author{Author 2}       ### but if you have several authors
\author{Author 3}       ### and miss out one of their email addresses
\email{Email 3}         ### then the order will mess up

### Anything else like \usepackage{...} or \tryingtobeclever{intheheader}
### is completely redundant - texml will simply ignore it

%@interestinglink.xml   ### Use this syntax for linking to related XML files.
%@another-interestinglink.xml

%#Tagged                ### MFN uses a tagging system to sort information.
%#LieGroups             ### If you want to tag a fieldnote as something to do
                        ### with Lie groups, use the tag %#LieGroups.
                        ### The % is there to hide this from TeX if it were ever
                        ### compiled (and the %# syntax alerts texml to the presence
                        ### of this tag).

\begin{document}        ### This is a key line which tells texml to start processing
                        ### the document proper (rather than the metadata).

\section{Section name}

You can type maths like this $\pi r^2$ or like this
\[G_{\mu\nu}=8\pi T_{\mu\nu}\]

\begin{Lemma}
    You can use environments and call them whatever you want.
\end{Lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Proofs are hidden and expand on demand.
\end{proof}

\begin{Giraffe}
    Really whatever you want.
\end{Giraffe}

\section{New section}

\begin{Example}[labelgoeshere]  ### You can use labels so that you can refer
    Example                     ### back to stuff using <a> tags
\end{Example}

Here is a <a link="lagrangian-phase.xml" lid="phasedfn"/> to a 
specific label (phasedfn) on another page (lagrangian-phase.xml). This will show as 
the precise number of the labelled object (e.g. Definition 1.2).

Here is a <a link="lagrangian-grassmannian.xml">link</a> to another page.

<table>
<tr><td>Tables work as in HTML</td></tr>
</table>

So do:
<ul>
<li>Lists</li>
<li>(Ordered or unordered)</li>
<li>but don't forget to close your li tags or else XML will have a fit</li>
</ul>

\begin{Theorem}
    There you have it. That's almost it.
\end{Theorem}

\end{document}          ### Yes, you need this to inform texml that you're done.
